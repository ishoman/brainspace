## Brainstorm Process

_I've decided to make a mobile app first. Most people who are independent contractors/artists are constantly on the go. A solid mobile layout will be key to drawing in customers for the client._
_In looking at WeWork and TechSpace, they both have layouts that feature a lot of carousels/slideshows which promote flowing spaces and thought. I like the general idea of that, but I think having a whole page of slideshows is a little overpowering._
